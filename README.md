# BarStream
Final Project for Web Design.
'Official' Site: https://adv-web-design-joeph465.c9users.io/FinalProject/

Uses Google Maps API and Twitter API to show the nearest bars and grab Tweets about them.

Last.fm API just gets top artists, temporary fix considering I can't use Instagram API to fetch public posts (about nearby activity) relating to the bars.

Took out all my API keys/secrets, so this code will NOT work alone.
