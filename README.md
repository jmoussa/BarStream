# BarStream
Final Project for Web Design.
'Official' Site: https://adv-web-design-joeph465.c9users.io/FinalProject/

Uses Google Maps API and Twitter API to show the nearest bars and grab Tweets about them.

Last.fm API just gets top artists, temporary fix considering I can't use Instagram API to fetch public posts (about nearby activity) relating to the bars.

Took out all my API keys/secrets, so this code will NOT work alone.

# Use
Simply allow the browser to track your location
When it's finished loading, it should grab all twitter posts from each bar in your area.

Also can drag the marker to explore other areas and other bars.
